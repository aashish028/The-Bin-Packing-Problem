# The-Bin-Packing-Problem
BPP is a significant problem which is exploited in various fields and different applications. Because of its NP-hard nature, lots of approximation algorithms have been presented for it. In this project, an approximation algorithm with the best possible theoretical factors, linear time order, constant-space, and approximation ratio of 3/2, was presented. The algorithm works based on dividing input items into equal ranges and matching them with each other in a special way.
